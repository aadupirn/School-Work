-Combinational Logic
    output is a function of the input.
    output - f(input)

-Sequential Logic
    Output = f(input, input history)
    function of input and input history

-Finite State Machine:
    FSMs are made up of:
        input symbol alphabet
        output symbol alphabet
        set of states(one is a start state)
        set of transitions

-Implementing FSM in hardware
    Memory: Flip-flops to store state values.
    State Logic: Logic network that takes the present state, inputs and produces signals that will drive the circuit to the next staet.
    Output Logic: Produces Outputs Based on Present State (and possibly inputs)
        Moore Machine -> Outputs depend on the present state (not inputs)
        Mealy Machine -> Outputs depend on bot the present state AND inputs.
    Clock: Synchronous state machines transition on clock edge.
    Reset: Returns machine to default state.

-Creating FSM's in this class
    Remember to specify CLOCK
    Default State
    Reset State is by default to active low reset.
    if a transition is not specified then on the next transition it will move.
    Set priorities if two branches can happen at once.
    Give the staets meaningful names so that debugging is easy.

-Design Project #2: Checksummer
    Checksums used to ensure data integrity.

    00000001 00000101 00000000 00000010
                4 Byte Date Frame
    Checksum = 00001000

    1+5+0+2 = 8

-Inputs
    clock: synchronous
    reset: asynchronous active-high
    DataIn: 8-bit bus that accepts a new byte on the falling edge of the clock.

-Outputs
    ChecksumError: asserted for one clock cycle following the data payload if there is a checksum error in the data packet.
    CheckValid: CheckValid is asserted once the checksum operation for the current packet has been completed and the Checksum is valid.

-Data Frame
    Sync Character 1    Sync Character 2    length  data payload    checksum
    8-bits              8bits               8bits   'length'-bytes  8-bits

    Sync Characters: 00110011 11001100

-Think of in 2 components: datapath/hardware, and a FSM that is controlling this.
