---- 2001: A Space Odyssey Movie Notes ----
-Dark screen with weird sound effects for a couple minutes.
-Apes are scared of leopard when it attacks.
-obelisk shows up.
    -apes seem more worried about it than they were in the movie. Freak out a lot more. Kind of worship it.
    -No explicit obelisk light show or TV thing. Just ape figure out how to use bone weapon.
-Thrown bone becomes space satellite.
-In the book the spaceship has a part that spins the other way to allow ships to dock. In the movie both docking ship and spacebort spins.
-Same song every time a ship docks.
