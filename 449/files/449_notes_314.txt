-Allocation Strategies
	-First First - find the first free block that can accomidate teth request.
	-Next Fit - find the first block, starting where the last search left off that can ccomidaate the request.
	-Best Fit - find the free block that is closest in the size to the request
	-Worst Fit - find teh free block with the most left over after fulfilling the allocation request.
	-Quick Fit - Keep several lists of free blocks of common sizes, allocate from the list that nearest matches the request.

	void *mymalloc(size){
		return sbrk(size + sizeof(struct node)) + sizeof(struct node););
	}
	
	free(void * p)
	{
		node = p=sizeof(node);
	}
