Hello world in C:

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf("Hello, world! \n");
	return 0;
}

- you return an int in the main function. This is passed back to the OS and can be queried to see if the program ran successfully.
- there is no class unlike java. C is not object oriented it is procedural.
- all of the code will live in functions and all of the data is just data. THERE ARE NO OBJECTS. no inheritance or polymorphism. 
- #include will allow us to access other libraries.
- C has a much smaller standard library than Java.

- Data Types
	- Integers
		- JAVA
			- int 
				- 32 bits, +/- 2.1 billion in java
			- short 
				- 16 bits, +/- 32,767 in java
			- long 
				- 64 bits huge number in java
		- In C (short <= int <= long && short < long)
			- int will be the native word size.
			- if int = 32, short = 16, long = 32. (32 bit systems)
				- long kept at 32 bits after upgrader from 16 to 32 bit to maintain backwards compatability.
			- On 64 bit systems int = 32, short = 16, long = 64.
			- short is at least 16, long is at least 32. 
	- Real
	- Text
- C runs on the actual machine so it depends on the machine you are using. It compiles into an executable that gives your actual processor instructions.

1/11/16

-int is really short int.

-long is really long int

-short is short int

-in C you can specify unsigned and signed

-char data type can be integer or text

-Integer adjectives:
	char <--typically 8 bits
	short
	int
	long
	long long

-sizeof() <-- keyword(evaluated at compile time)
	- will take type or expression
		-if type will tell you the size of the type in bytes so sizeof(char)=1. Number of char's it takes up.
		-if expression it will find out what the size of the type that the expression yields. Still number of char's it takes up.
		-whatever we pass to it must be knowable at compiletime. It doesn't exist after compilation. All you will see is the answer in the compiled machine code.
-Static = occurs at compile time
-Dynamic = occurs at runtime

-reals
	-float (32 bit, 7 digits of decimal precision)
	-double	(64 bit, 15 digits of decimal precision)
	-long double
	-We are going to store floating point numbers by storing an integer and an exponent to create a number that otherwize would be much more difficult to express.
	-You can also store huge numbers like this but you will lose precision at lower digits.
-Text adjectives:
	char

-No strings since strings are objects.
-NO BOOLEANS!?!?
	-Represent booleans with int. You can use int within a boolean context.
	-0 is false anything else is true.
		-0 = FALSE
		-1,4,234,-2,-69,69 all are TRUE
		-this means you can do false + 3 which equals 3.
		-C WILL compile this.

-Operators

-Arithmetic:
	-*
	-/
		3/5 -> 0
	-%
		Only done with integers
	-+
	--
	-(
	-)

-Comparison
	-<
	->
	-<=
	->=
	-==
	-!=

	-False comparison will return 0. Most of the time true comparison will return 1 but that might not work sometimes.

-Logical
	-&&
	-||
	-!

-Bitwise
	-&
	-|
	-~
		-Compliment(flips bits)
	-^
		-XOR
	-<<
		-Left Shift(Creates 0's)
	->>
		-Right Shift
		-if you are using a signed number you will extent the most significant bit.
		-if you are using an unsigned number you will add 0's.

1/13/16

	-Bitwise operations treat the integers as an array of booleans.

-Identifiers
	-composed of letters numbers and underscores (_).
	-uses ascii not Unicode.
	-can't start with a number.
	-shouldn't start h a _
		-_Bool is the bool type.

	-java convention numStudents.
	-c convention num_students

-delare variables
	-type identifier;
		int x;
		char y;
	-you can combine multiple declarations on the same line (int x, y;)
		-probably shouldnt. 
			-do this instead
				int x;
				int y;
	-you can also declare and initialize on the same line 
		-int x = z;
		-initialization is a different operation than an assignment.
		-if you dont initialize you will get a warning.

-Blocks { }
	-blocks define scopes
	{
		int x = 2;	//declaration
		x = x+1;	//use
		int y = 3;	//declaration
	}
	-^legal in C99 but89.
	-C89 depends on a split where declarations do and dont happen.
	-anything after the first non-declaring use cannot declare a new variable (c89)
	{
		int x = 2;	//declarations
		int y = 3;
		x = x+1;	//use
	}
	-^legal in both
	-this allows for one pass compilers to work.
		-one pass compiler visits each line of code once.
	-x=x+1 is an assignment not an initialization. Its a non-declaring use which makes it different.
	-we are using a bastardization that allows for the C99 rules.

-Assignment
	-=
	-right associative.
	-things on the right of the equals sign are done first.
	-everything else is left.
	-you can chain the = with the operators.
	-x += 1; ---> x = x+1
	-also x++ and ++x.

-Comments
	- /*   */ (C89)
	- // works in C99 and really any compiler these days because C++ supports it.

-I/O
	-#include <stdio.h>
	-printf("Hello world \n");
		-use interpolation instead of concatenation.
		-put into format string.
			1) Literal text is output literally.
			2) Placeholders
		-Escape sequences
			-\n, \", \', \\, \r, \v, \t, \a
		-Scan Codes
			-%d <-- decimal(int)
			-%x <-- print in hex
				-%X <-- prints uppercase letters
			-%o <-- print in octal
			-%u <-- unsigned
			-%f <-- double (will print the entire number even if it is huge)
			-%e <-- scientific notation (1e^7, 2.3e^-2)
				-%E <-- prints uppercase letters
			-%g <-- picks %f or %e based on how long the stringified version of the value is.
				-$G <-- prints uppercase letters
			-%c <-- character (ascii)
			-%s <-- string
			-%p <-- pointers
			-%% <-- single percent sign
			-printf("The value of x is %d\n",x);
				The value of x is 3
		-you can put in multiple scan codes and then variables or expressions from left to right after text.
		

1/20/16

		-returns an int
			-if positive its the # of chars printed
			-if negative error.
		-%.2f
		    ^ precision
			-this would truncate to 2 decimal points.
		-%5.2f
		   ^ field width
			- you will make spaces before the number if you dont have as many characters as the field width.
				-3.14
				-  3.14
		-%05.2
			-will pad the number with 0's instead of spaces
				-3.14 --> 03.14
		-%-05.2 
			-will pad the number with 0's after the number
				-3.14 --> 3.140
		-after precision between percent and type you can include type width modifyer.	
			-%hd = short
			-%ld = long
			-%lld = long long
			-%Ld = long double
		-
			x=10;
			printf("0x%08x", x);
		-output = 0x0000000a
		-printf("%#08x", x); does the same thing 
	
	-int scanf(format, vars);
		- 
			int x
			printf("Enter a number:");
			scanf("%d", &x);
		-whats in the format string will never show up on screen put that in a printf
		-literal text in the format string is matched literally except for whitespace which matches whitespace.
		-say I want to read in the numbers from the data 1999-01-31
			-"%d-%d-%d", &year, &month, &day
		-will return the number of scan codes successfully parsed.
	-Buffered I/O
		-what causes the stuff in the buffer to be shown on screen.
			1) buffer is full
			2) explicityly flush
			3) Ends with \n (will be flushed)
		-printf("hello"); won't print to the console.
		-scanf process
			1) If buffer is empty, prompt for input, copy to output
			2) Attempt to parse according to format string
	-scanf strings doesnt need &
	-
		scanf("%s", str);
		type in: The quick brown fox *enter*
		-only "the" will be read in
		-%s will only read in one whitespace delimited series of characters.
	- 
		int x;
		char c;
		scanf("%d", &x);
		scanf("%c", &c);
	-entering 5 *enter* will cause the program to exit.
		-newline will read in as a character.
	-scanf("%[ ]", str);
		          ^ you put what is allowed to go into the string in here.
		-if "^" is the first character then it will read everything that is not between the brackers.
			-"^\n" will read in until you hit the new line.
	-fgets(stdin, 255, str);
		-input device (stdin is standard input)
		-max number of characters.
		-variable name (must include at least max number of characters and will stop at newline but include new line)
-Control Structures
	-
		if(condition)
		1) single statement
		2) empty statement <-- mistake
		3) block
	-use only blocks, you can use single statements but its safer to go with blocks.

1/25/16

	-else works the same way, use blocks to be safe.
	-else if... else if... else works the same way. <-- reallying if and else statements chained together
		switch(x)//x has to be int or char
		{
			case 2:
			case 3:
				break;
			default:
		}
	while(condition)
	{
		
	}
	do{

	}while(condition);

	-for loop ---> for( 1 ; 2 ; 3 )
		1) initialization
			-you can use comma to initialize multiple variables
		2)	while condition
			-commas not here since it only returns the right most thing.
		3)	update
			-you can update multiple variables with ","
	-if(condition)
		break;
		-no braces will take you out of outside loupt.
		continue;
		-will take you to the top. evaluate while loop again. even in do while.
	-while(	)
		while(	)
			if(	)
				break;

	-break will break out of second while. (the closest loop)
-Control
	-goto
	-goto LABEL;

	LABEL:
	-stylistically goto is very bad.
	
-functions
	int f(int x)
	{
		return x;
	}
	int main ()
	{
		return 0;
	}
	-call of function is considereed the use.
	-int f(int x) is definition and declaration.
	-declare int f(int);
	-function prototype
		-prototype does not need to match the names of the parameters.
	-c89 default prototype
		-risky.
	-#include prototypes or implements functions.
	-#include is pretty much a mass prototype.
		-header files never include implementation code.
-Arrays
	-An aggregate, homogenous data structure.
	-homogenous = all the same data type.
	-aggregate = all the same name
	-int a[10];
	-type name[size];
	-sizeof will return 40 since that is the number of bytes.
	-sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]) <-works sometimes
		-only works when array is in scope can't see the declaration of the array outside of the scope.
		-sizeof also only works at compiletime constant.

1/27/16

	-if you want to use arrays as a parameter needs to get passed an integer length of the array also.
	-you have to remember to pass the length of the array around.
	-accessing invalid index in array:
		1)Program could crash
		2)Silent corruption of data.
	-Java checks every time you access an array element at runtime.
		-virtual machine does this.
		-it will make the runtime slow.
		-there is no C vm.
		-there is no easy way for C to determine the length of the array.
	int n;
	scanf("%d", &n);
	int a[n]; <-- not legal C89
	-you are using a declaration after a use.
	-legal in C99
	-C99 has a variable length array.
-Strings in C
1)Array of chars.
2)Terminated with a sentinel. (NUL)
char str[100];
#include <string.h>
	-strcpy(str, "Hello");
	-strcpy copies string strcpy(destination, source);
	-length of array is 100 but length of string is 5. <-- problem.
-Variable-length data
	-Explicit length variable.
	-Sentinel value
		-mark end with a special marker
	-Replacing character.
		-str[0] = 'h';
	-concatenate 2 strings
		-strcat(left side, right side);
		-strcat(str, "there");
		-assigns string to first parameter. Is one of the sources and the destination.
		-if you want to keep first string strcpy first.
	-strlen(str)
		-returns length of the string.
	-compare two strings, strcmp
		strcmp(a,b)
		-returns <0 a<b
		-returns 0 a=b
		-returns >0 a>b
		-!strcmp(a,b) <-- looks like they are not equal but really a boolean false is 0 which means they are equal.
	-C uses the sentinel value.
	-ASCII 0 is NUL
	-'\0' is NUL escape sequence.
	-'0' is 48 in ascii.
	-string literal automatcally has a NUL terminal at its end.

2/8/16

-character's have single quotes '
-pass pointers to functions
-change parameters(outputs)
-name of an array can stand in for a pointer to the start of that memory.
-every array is passed by address at the beginning of the array.
-if you passed an entire array you'd have to clone the entire array.
-t->artist 
	-left hand side is pointer to struct
	-right hand side is part of struct
	-you have to pass a struct's pointer 
	-and *t.artist doesn't work you have to (*t).artist
	-a[0] = *a
	-a[1] = *(a + 1)

-pointer arithmetic 
	-pointer + int
	-pointer - int
	-pointer-pointer
-automaticlaly scaled by the size of the type.

	-a[i] = *(a+i)

-if you want to access the middle addresses 
	-void *p; //void pointer
	-p=a;
	-pointer arithmetic will incremeent address by 1 not the size by of type.
	-if you want to dereference a void pointer you have to cast to a type. you can't directly dereference a void pointer.

-FILE *f = fopen("filename", "mode");

- atoi(argv[5]); will turn track into a number <----- I need to do this.

-FILE * <-- pointer to opaque type
-once you consume some data it will advance the file pointer.
-if f == null then something wrong happened.

2/10/16

-FILE * fopen(filename, mode)
	-w creates a new filE
	-open in w mode no reading, open in r no writing.
	-"+" modes fix this.
	-r+ file must already exist
	-w+ file is overwritten/created
	-a+ reads start at the begginning but all writes are appends.
	- t or b can also be specified in the mode.
		-t = text mode
			-"\n"
		-b = binary mode
			-some portion of the data is meant to be read by the computer.
	- fprintf(f, format string, variables);
-fwrite(void*, size, count FILE *);
-size and count 
	-what do I want to happend if file contains less data than was asked for.
	-fread returns how many things of size were successfully read
	-return of negative number is error.
	-0 means that there is no error but there is no data there.
-int feof(FILE*);
	-checks if EOF marker has been consumed
-Dynamic Allocation
	-Unkown size until runtime
	-Unknown number until runtime
	
	-memory allocation done with { void* malloc(int size);}
	-will return a contiguous chunk of memory at least as small as you asked for.
	-returns the address of where the memory is.
	-int *a;
	-a = malloc(n*sizeof(int));
	-#include <stdlib.h>
	-void pointers can be assigned to any other pointer type without a cast.
	-don't cast the return value of malloc, can secrety break things.
	-if (a == null) malloc did not work.
	-malloc will never fail on linux. 
	-check against null
	-with malloc the memory never goes away.
		-memory stays there till the process terminates.
		-still once something is allocated it can never be used again.
	-when you are done with it free(a);
	-you have to free the exact value returned by malloc. you can free a different variable.
	-if you forget to free something you have a memory leak.
-Scope
	-Where in the code a variable name is legal to refer to its value.
	-SCOPE ISN'T REAL

-2/15/16

-why scope?
	-reuse variable names.
	-encapsulation.
	-enforced by compiler.
	-static concept
	-"local variables"
		-scope is the block
	-"global"
		-file scoped variable.
-lifetime
	-from allocation to deallocation.
	-dynamic (while program is running)\
	-"local"
		-function call --> return
	-"global"
		-lifetime of program.
	-malloc's lifetime is set by the user.
		-the variables referring to the malloc have their own scope and lifetime.
-think of every combination of lifetime and scope. block and program and file and function.
	-there are no file scope and function lifetime.
	-block scope  but program lifetime exists in c.
		-prefix local variable with static.
		-static int x = 2;
		-x++;
			-a function with the above will initialize x to 2 once then every time after will add it. 
			-if I just had x = 2 will then reassign x to 2 every time. 

-Executables and Linking
-compiler
	-c source --preprocessor preprocessed source compiler object files linker--> exectuable
	-c preprocessor is a textual transformation of source code.
		-#include is a preprocessor command that opens the header file specified
	-compiler
		-takes c and produces machine code or assembly language.
		-compiler produces object file.
	-object files
		-pretty much machine code.
		-you might not have implemented everything you need
	-linker 
		-weaves the object files together and resolves undefined labels to their actual addresses.
-Executables	
	-what do we need to store?
		-code
		-data
		-more?
	-agree with comon format.
	-consumed by operating system
	-a.out (assembler output)
		-older UNIX format
		-no longer commonly used
	-COFF(common object file format)
		-older UNIX Format
		-no longer commonly used.
	-PE (Portable Executable)
		-based on COFF
		-used in 32- and 64-bit Windows
	-ELF (Executable and Linkable Format)
		-Lunux/UNIX
	-Mach-O file
		-Mac
-a.out format
	-exec header
	-text segment
	-data segment
	-text relocations
	-data relocations
	-symbol table
	-string table.

-Deduplication
	-removes duplication
	-why store 100 million of the same thing when you can store it once and give everyone a reference.
	-to avoid deduplication do char c[100]; then strcpy(c, "hello");
	-every a.out formatted binarry file begins with an exec structure.
		-magic number tells operating system what kind of file it is.
		-bss tells how many bytes of zeroed space there is.

2/22/15

-Static Linking
	-copy code into executable at compile time, done by linker
	-dynamic linking
	-copy code into address space at load time or later
	-done by link loader.
	-dynamic linking is default. 
-Fntion Pointers
	-how do we call a function when we can't be sure what address it's loaded at?
	-need a level of indireciton.

	
	int f(int x)	
	{
		return x;
	}

	function pointer:
	int (*g)(int x);
	g = f;

	you can then call g;

-x86 or Oh No! Not Another Assembler!
-CISC vs. RISC
	-x86 is the epitme of a Complex Instruction Set Computer 
	-hundreds of instructions
	-someone said they'd buy a bunch of processors if you added this instructions.
-gcc and gas use the AT&T syntax
	-opcode appended by type
	-b - byte 8 bit
	-w - word 16 bit
	-l - long 32 bit
	- q quad 64 bit
	-first operand is source
	-second is destination
	-memory dereferences are denoted by ()
	-some operations use the same register for source and destination.
	-registers are prefixed by a %
	-immediates are prefixed by a $

2/24/16

-common syntax use Intel Syntax
	-BYTE, WORD, DWORD, QWORD
	-first operand is destination
	-second operation is source
	-memory dereferences are denoted by []
	-registers use $
	-immediates dont have prefix
	-need to know this shit if we are looking at outside documentations.
-Stacks, Frames and Calling Conventions.
-Stack
	-region of memory managed in a last-in first-out fashion.
	-Activation Record.
	-an object containing all the necessary data for a function
		-values of parameters
		-count of number of arguments
		-return address
		-return value
-x86 Calling Convention
	-$EAX, $ECX, and $EDX are generally caller-saved.
	-three registers are probably insufficient.
	-most register are spilled onto the stack
	-$EAX is the return value
	-everything else is on the stack.

2/29/16

-main does some stuff to a line in its activation record. Storage rounded up to 16 bytes so things stay alligned. parameters are offsets of the base pointer.
-parameters are pushed right to left onto the stack. Why?
	-int printf(const char *format, ...)
	-"..." means fariabe number of arguments.
	-the thing you need to know where it is is the format string. 
-variatic functions are functions that take arbitrary number of arguments.
	-#include <stdarg.h>
-Buffer Overrun Vulnerability.

3/14

-Allocation Strategies
	-First First - find the first free block that can accomidate teth request.
	-Next Fit - find the first block, starting where the last search left off that can ccomidaate the request.
	-Best Fit - find the free block that is closest in the size to the request
	-Worst Fit - find teh free block with the most left over after fulfilling the allocation request.
	-Quick Fit - Keep several lists of free blocks of common sizes, allocate from the list that nearest matches the request.
	
	-Project
	void *mymalloc(size){
		return sbrk(size + sizeof(struct node)) + sizeof(struct node););
	}

	HELP

3/21/16

Practical C Issues:
-#include
	-Copies the contents of the specified file into the current file
	-<> indicate to look in a known location for includes
	-"" indicate to look in the current directory or specified path. 
	-Textual Symbol replacements is done with #define.
		#define PI 3.1415926535
		#define MAX 10
		-NULL is defined as a 0 cast to a void pointer.
	-preprocessor does the replacement according to the rules of C. (doesn't do it in comments).
	-Textual replacemeents with parameters.
	good:
		#define MAX(a, b) (a > b) ? a : b
	not so good
		#define SWAP(a, b) {int t = a; a = b; b = t}
	?operator
		-takes 3 operands (only one in c)
	First operand is and expression evaluated in a boolean context (expr)
	?
	The two expressions separated by a colon.
	first one is what happens if true
	second is what happens if false
	
		(expr) ? trueCaseExpr : falseCaseExpr

	x = (3<5)>7:2;
	x = 7.

	-End of line terminates macro.
	-by not being a function you don't have an activation record which saves on time and memory in some cases.
	-you are putting the body of the function every time the macro is "called".
		-inline functions.
	-functions exist because you want to deduplicate code but it also deduplicates in the machine code.
	-macros don't deduplicate machine code. 
		-at some time the code growth will cause performance problems. 
	-you can use a macro on any data type this doesn't work with functions. 
		-you can only call MAX on something that can be compared by >.
	-Correct way to define max is MAX(a, b) (((a)>(b))?(a):(b))
	-this is done so you can actually keep order of operations when using the macro as a function. 
	-can't have return statement in a macro since you would return out of the outer function.
	-have to use ?: since it is an if expression you can't have a statement in the function. 
-#if<condition that can be evaluated by the preprocessor>
-What does preprocessor know?
	-values of #defined variables
	-constants
	-used for CONDITIONAL COMPILATION
	-preprocessor will removes stuff if #if condition is zero will never make it to compilation.
	-nested block comments will mess up
		-#if can do this.

3/23/16

-you can do things to implement code if a version is greater than a number.
-#if
-#elif
-#else
-#endif
-#if defined
	-#if defined
	-checks to see if a macro has been defined but doesn't care about the falue.
	-#endif after
-#undef will undefine a symbol.
-#if defined = #ifdef
-#if !defined = #ifndef
-Uses
	-handle operating system/architecture specific code.
	-handle differences in compilers.
	-build program with different features.
-you can use this for debug. They won't appear in the preprocessor at all
-you can compile with -D to define something
--DVERSION=5;
--DMACRO
-you never have to edit code to run in debug mode.
-#quotes a string
-## concatenates two strings
-#pragma
-#warn
-#error
-Defined Constants 
	__FILE__
	__LINE__ - Line number I'm At!
	__DATE__
	__TIME__
	__STDC__ -compiler support for C
	_ -other compiler specific stuff.
-typedef type-declaration synonym;
-Typedef helps with structs

typedef struct node {
	int i;
	struct node *next;
} Node;

-useful for function pointers also

-Function pointers as parameters.
-qsort has three paremters
	-void * to the base to an array.
	-size of the array.
	-size of single element.
	-function pointer that compares and returns an int.
		-that function takes 2 parameters that are pointers.
		-int tells you comparison 
-You have to write custom comparison function

int compare_ints(const void *a, const void *b)
{
	int x = (int*)a;
	int *x = (int *) b;
	return *x - *y;
}

-Multi-file development
-want to break up a program into multiple files
	-easier to maintain.
	-multiple authors.
	-quick compilation
	-modularity.

-Static Local Scope
	-Scope: Local
	-Lifetime: Global
-Global Variables are actually limited to the file
-extern maybe use dto import variables from other files.
-files are compiled separately
-put all files in same gcc command.

-gcc a.c b.c
	./a.out
-if static in global scope
	-will make it private to file.

-3/28/16
-Header files
	-usually only contain declarations
		-types
		-functions
		-#define macros
	-paired with an implementation file. 
-Driver
	-#include "mymalloc.h"
	-can now use those functions
	-compile all files on command line
-Makefiles
	-express what files depend upon others
	-if any are modified, build smallest set required.
	-dependency graph
	-gcc -c output is o file.
	-uses timestamp to determine when to compile.
-Operating Systems
	-manage resources
	-abstract details.
-System Call
	-an operation (function) that an OS provides for running applications to use.
-Kernel 
	-The core process of the operating system.

3/30/16

-use control transfer for system call.
-context switch
-the act of switching from one process to another.
	-general purpose registers
	-program counter
	-cpu status word
	-stack pointer
	-memory management details
-you can miss output because of buffer.
-325 different syscall slots. not all are used.
	-read
	-write
	-open
	-close
	-create
-a number can represent a bunch of booleans with each bit being a boolean.

-4/4/16

-operating system might ofer things c standard library does not so you just want to use that.
-you can also skip a layer by directly referencing them.
-use c standard library for better portability and to standardize things only use syscalls if you need to.
-One thing that you need syscalls for is fork()
-fork
	-creates a new process identical to the calling one.
	-return value differs
		-"child" process return value is 0
		-"parent" process gets childs process id number
	-Often used with execv family of functions to launch a new program.
	-fork creates an identical clone of the running process.
-believe scheduling is random.

-Device Drivers

-4/6/16
-Software Layers
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
		User-level I/O software and libraries
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
		Device-independent OS software
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
		Device Drivers
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
		Interrupt handlers
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
		Hardware
	----------------------------------------------------------------------
-Same system call to print to screen and write to disk
	-to screen uses file descriptor 1 that represents system out.
-Device drivers now how to talk to the hardware.
-Hardware talks back.
	-Tells when its done, needs more data, or when something gos wrong/something needs to be done.
-How do you get the OS to pay attention if the OS isn't running.
	-You make an interrupt
	-Stop what your are doing and switch to the operating system.
	-Parallel to software interrupt is a hardware interrupt
	-signal to cpu and does the same thing a software interrupt does just not caused by a syscall its done by a hardware device.
	-Does same thing: Stop what you are doing look up system call and transfer controll to OS.
-Job of interrupt handler layer is to pass info up to device driver.
-Hit keys causes keyboard data to be copied to OS to user program.
	-Write that to disk you talk to OS which talks to disk driver which talks to the disk controller which talks to the physical hard drive.
-Do you have to write software for each device uniquely?
-Devices are not so wierd as to require individual attention.
-OS looks at devices in three categories.
	-OS doesn't need to know anything about your specific device just needs to know the kinds of things it can do.
-Types of devices
-Block Devices
	-A device that stores data in fixed-sized blocks each uniquely addressed, and can be randomly accessed.
		-Disks, flash drives, etc...
-Character devices,
	-Device that delivers or accepts a stream of characters.
		-Keyboard, mouse, terminal, etc...
	-Character devices stream data.
		-if you don't capture it it is gone forever
-None of the Above
	-Pretty small chategory.
	-Best example = clock. (doesn't stream data and itsn't indexable)
-OS manages devices coarsly based on what a device claims to be.
-Drivers are doers.
-Drivers should enable the device to do anything possible with the device.
-Driver shouln't make a decision about the legality of doing anything.
-Mechanism: what  capabilities to have (algorithm).
-Policy: How to use a mechanism (parameters).
-Drivers should only care about mechanisms.
-Device Drivers in Linux
	-Can be compiled into the kernel.
	-Can be loaded dynamically as Modules.
	-Modules are dynamic loading otherwise is static.
	-You can extend the OS code with either.
-/dev (stands for device)
	-Has a virtual filesystem (fake filesystem, doesn't take up any space on a block device)
	-everything in linux is a file.
	-Devices get filenames.
	-Character and block devices can be exposed via a filesystem.
	-/dev/ typically contains "files" that represent the different devices on a system.
	-/dev/console - the console
	-/dev/fd/- a process's open file descriptors.
-/proc
	-virtual filesystem with information about the system and running programs
	-/proc/cpuinfo-test "file" containing CPU information.
-Sysfs
	-exports information about devices and drivers to userspace
	-can configure aspects of a device
	-/sys/
	-qmu 
-kernel is not linked to C standard library.
	-kernel does not do all of the thing c standard library does.
	-You do get a limited subset of C standard library.
	-printf is not there.
	-printk
		-print from kernel.
		-you're already in the OS
	-printing in kernel goes to log.
