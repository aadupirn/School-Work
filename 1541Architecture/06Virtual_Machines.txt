-Why do we have operating systems?
    -manage processes.

-Sharing resources in an OS:
    Time sharing (multiplexing) the processor
    space sharing (multiplexing) the memory
    on demand sharing of I/O

-Maps virtual resources to physical resources.
    Memory, I/O devices, CPUs
    Guest code runs on native machine in user mode.
        Trap to VMM on instructions that acess protected resources.
        VMM handles real IO devices.

-Physical memory as a cache for the virtual memory.
    Miss penalty (cost of a page fault) = 1M - 10M cycles (to access hdd)
        page fault.
