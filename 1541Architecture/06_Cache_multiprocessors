-3 states modified shared or invalid
-snoopy protocol.
    A coherence protocol for write back caches
        Clean: in all caches and up to date in memory, or
        dirty: in exactly one cache or
        uncached: not in any caches.
    Correspondingly we record the state of each block in a cache as:
        shared: clean read only
        exclusive(modified): cache has only copy, it is writeable, and dirty.
        Invalid: block contains no data.
