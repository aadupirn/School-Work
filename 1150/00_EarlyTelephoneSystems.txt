-Homework assigned at end of class that will be due next Friday.

-When you analyze antennas always compare to isotropic
 case.

-Active rf systems have external power source (vs passive).

-Why when you rotate reciever does the power drop off?
-Antenna Polarization
    EM waves described as propogating E (electric) and H (magnetic) field vectors.
    Transfer of energy occurs with E Vector
    For an EM wave, the bolarization is the plane in which the electric field oscillates.

    In order to maximize the received signal, it is
    important to match the polarization of the
    antenna to that of the incoming signal

-Friis transmission equation is a closed form expression for the power recieved.
    Assume isotropic

    Srx = Ptx * 1/(4pir^2) (W/m^2)

    Factor in Antenna specifics

    Srx = Gtx * Ptx/(4piR^2)

    Using Effective are of the recieving (Rx) antenna

    Prx = Srx * Ae = (Gtx)(Ptx)(Aerx)/(4pir^2)

    What is Ae = G * (lambda^2)/(4piR^2) (m^2)

    Complete expression for the power recieved.

    Prx = Ptx(GtxGrx(lambda^2))/(4pir^2) [W]

-What can we discern from this?
    Power recieved is proportional to:
        Power transmitted
        Gain of both antennas
        wavelenth^2
        1/R^2

-Path Loss: the difference between the transmitted and recieved power.

-Example: Satellite TV system radiates 120W of power from a distance of 38000 km from the user's home. The frequency band is centerd around 12.5 GHz and the gains of both antennae are 34 dB how much power is recieved?
    Gain values in Friis is straight not in DB

    34dB = 10log10(x)
    x = 2500

    Prx = 2 pW

-Example: A bluetooth mouse requires a signal on the order of 10 nW in order to function properly. The base station transmits 1 mW at 2.4 GHz. The gains of both antennae are 2 dB. How far away can the mouse operate.

    1 nW = 1 mW (2 dB)^2(...)

    r is variable

    r = 5m

    Remember to convert frequencies to wavelengths!

    c = (lambda)f

-Frequency shift Key
    When you want to specify a bit you have to decrease or increase frequency slightly.

- IMTS Improved Mobile Telephone System
    It was a significant improvement on making a mobile practical.
    You can now directly dial people.
    Introduced automatic channel selection.
    Switched to ability to have a full duplex conversation.
    Idea of in band signaling.
        Once the communication link was established the same band used to communicate was used to signal.

    Drawbacks:
        12 channels. (In NYC there was 2000 subscribers.)
        There was a lot of waiting for finding the free channel.
        It was popular and expensive. Phone was $2000 (1970 $$$), also a dollar a minute for the conversation.
        Took a lot of power. 25W from mobile transmitter and 100W from base.

-You can still decrease power on transmitters in order to split up a region.
