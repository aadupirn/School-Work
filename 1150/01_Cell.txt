-Going "Cellular"
    1947 Bell Laboratories Internal Memo
    Required some small infrastructure changes but most stuff was in change.
    Network of small geographical areas (cells)
    Transmitter in each cell
    traffic controlled by a central switch
    Frequencies reused by different cells

-Adjacent cells only use channels that aren't used by adjacent cells.
    Dipole antennas theoretically have circular radiation pattern.
    The set number of frequencies into which a F is divided is the reuse factor (k).
    F is the set of frequencies.
    T is the # of full duplex communication channels.
    Max # of simultaneous users/cell is T/k

-AMPS "1G Wireless"
    Like IMTS but incorporated cell idea and added ability to hand off conversation.
    824-849 is for mobile to cell
    869 -894 for cell to mobile (cell being base stations)
    30kHz channel width
        416 full Duplex channel
        395 for voice
        21 for signal control.

    If you divide by 7 you have 56 channels per cell

-Example
    960 voice channels available to us.
    area of one cell is 6km^2
    Coverage area of 2000km^2
    k=4
    what is max capacity?

    4*6 = 24
    2000/24 = 83
    960/4 = 240
    83*4*240 = 79,680 channels simultaneously being used in best case.

    if k = 7?
        46,000 channels

-You have sync bits.
-Message fields are 40 bits wide repeated 5 times for redundancy.

-Block code
    28 data bits/463 bits transmitted
    transmitted at a rate of 10 kbps

    so 605 bps of data transferred.
