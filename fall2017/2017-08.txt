    Introduction to Theory and Implementaiton is downloaded on laptop.


    Sets marked by {} ignore order and repitition.


    Multisets don''t ignore repitition.


    Sequence Order and repitiion matters uses ()

    #attack: exploitation of a vulnerability in order to realize a threat.


    __Security is Security is NOT an absolute property__


    Security Is a process


    1. Idenity threats for the domain of interest.


    2. Define policies to protect against these threats.


    3. Develop mechanisms to enforce these policies.


    4. Wash, rinse, repeat

    ==Chapter 2: Fundamentals==

    ===Formulas===

    c = lambda(v)\\

    E = hv\\

    lambda = wavelength\\

    v = frequ (Hz)\\

    c: speed of light(propogation in the medium)\\

    h: Planck''s constant


    ===Light and EM Spectrum===

    - colors we percieve are what the object reflects\\

    green objects reflect light with wavelengths primarily 500-570 nm range

    - Chromatic light bands: .43 - .79 um


    - #Radiance: total amount of energy\\

    - #Luminance (lm) the amount of energy an observer percieve.\\

    - #Brightness: a subjective descriptor of light perception that is impossible
    to measure.

    - #Intensity: black to white/ gray scale

    - Monochromatic light: void of color.



    ===Simple Image Formation Model===

    f(x, y) = i(x, y)r(x, y)


    f(x, y): intensity at the point (x, y)\\

    i(x, y): illumniation - amount of source illumination ) < i(x, y) < infinity <--
    We control this aspect\\

    r(x, y): reflectance/transmissivity. The abount of illuminations reflected/transmitted
    by object. 0 < r(x, y) < 1\\


    ===#Illumination===

    #Lumen: a unit of ligh tflow or luminous flux.\\

    Lumen per square meter (lm/m^2) -- the metric unit of measure for illumination
    of a surface.


    ===#Reflectance===

    - .01 for black velvet

    - .65 for stainless steel

    - .93 for snow


    To record L you need log2(maxvalueofL) bits


    #Interpolation: Process of using known data to estimate unknown values.

    - eg: zooming, shrinking rotating and geomatric correction.



    #interpolation, #resampling: an imaging method to increase or decrease the number
    of pixels in a digital image.
