-Static, multiple-issue (superscalar) pipelines
-Start more than one instruction in the same cycle.

-Expensive stuff in one thing and cheap stuff in a different pipeline.

-2 different paths and then you read 2 instructions at once. PC + 8.

-Having to do forwarding paths in a superscaler is a pain in the ass.

-Loop unrolling
    5 instructions per iterations to 8 instructions per 2 iterations.

-Handling exceptions:
    Modern os and debuggers depend on the hardware support for exceptions.
    Interrupt mechanism allows efficient use of CPU cycles by allowing the CPU to do useful work while waiting for an event.
