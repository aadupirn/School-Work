-Static, multiple-issue (superscalar) pipelines
-Start more than one instruction in the same cycle.

-Expensive stuff in one thing and cheap stuff in a different pipeline.

-2 different paths and then you read 2 instructions at once. PC + 8.

-Having to do forwarding paths in a superscaler is a pain in the ass.

-Loop unrolling
    5 instructions per iterations to 8 instructions per 2 iterations.
