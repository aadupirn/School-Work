-You have to assume or predict that the branch is not taken.
    You take corrective action and kill the actions behind.

-Predict “NOT TAKEN”
    Execute fall-off instructions that follow the branch (at PC+4, PC+8, ...)
    Squash (or cancel) instructions in pipeline if branch is actually taken

    (PC+4) already computed, so use it to get next instruction
-Predict “TAKEN”
    67% MIPS branches taken on average
    Start fetching from the branch target as soon it is available (useful if target address is computed earlier than the branch condition).

-Store branches you've taken and automatically assume they will be taken in the future.
