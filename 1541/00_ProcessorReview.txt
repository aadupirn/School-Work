Reviewed Processor from 447 so far. Hand-written notes for earlier stuff.

-Control
    takes op code and ALUOp to tell the other components what to do
    controls multiplexer inputs.
-What can change after execution?
    memory
    registers
    program counter
-To display things:
    Have control register and data register that tells the display to read from the data register and display it.

-Example: Calculate th time to execute an Add instruction assuming negligible delays except: memory (.2ns) ALU and adders (.2ns) register file access (.1ns)
    Answer: .2ns to read instruction + .1ns to read registers + .2ns for ALU operation + .1ns to write into register. = .6ns
    (R-type)

    You have to look at all paths that signals go through. You always have to take the longer path since clock speed has to accommodate both paths.
    In the example the PC path is shorter so you take the length of the other one.

-Example: Similarly, lw instruction time?
    Answer: .2ns to read instr + .1ns to read registers + .2ns for ALU operation + .2ns to read from data memory + .1ns to write into register = .8ns

-Clock architecture on worst possible propagation. (for above it would be .8ns)
