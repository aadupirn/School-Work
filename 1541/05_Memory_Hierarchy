-By time
    HDD/Flash > DRAM > L2 Cache/SRAM > L1 Cache/SRAM > CPU/Registers

-As you get faster you have less space. More expensive per byte.

-DRAM: built from capacitor. Charged = 1, otherwise = 0.
    volatile
    needs to be refreshed periodically
    reads are destructive

-SRAM cell is built from 6 transistors. faster but larger than DRAM.
    non-volatile-keeps its value
    does not need to be refreshed.
    reads are not destructive.

-Arranging cells in 2-d structure.

-Example:
    Assume a byte addressable memory that contains 512 bytes
    Need 9 bits to adress one of the 512 bytes.
    Bytes are arranged into an array of 64x8 bytes to keep an aspect ration of one.
    A 9 bit address into a row address (6 bits) and a byte address(3 bits).

-To get data you open a row and then select the byte you need.

-Use banks of data so you need to specify band row and collumn.

-A DIMM consists of 1-4 ranks mounted on a single printed circuit board.

-A Rank consists of multiple parallel chips contributing to the same transaction for example each of of 8 chips can provide a byte for a total of 64 data bits on the channel.

-A bemory chip is organized internally as a number of banks (1-8)

-Multiple banks can execute different commands at the same time.

-Disk Storage:

-HHD hybrid hard drive adds a non volatile cache using NAND flash memory.

-Localitya
    Spacial: nearby items will tend to be referenced soon.
    Temporal: items that have been referenced will probably be referenced again soon.

-Cache hit is when it is in cache miss is when it is not.

-What is the total number of bits needed for a 4KB cache assuming 32-bit address?

-What about an 8KB cache?
-20/32 bits * 4KB = space for tag.

-Direct map

-How to imporve performance - decrease miss ratio, large-blocks = small ratio.

-decreasing miss penalty.

-Effective miss rate is instruction miss rate + data miss rate.

-Calculate CPI considering stalls due to cache misses.
    example you have to add 40 cycles for every miss (miss penalty = 40)
