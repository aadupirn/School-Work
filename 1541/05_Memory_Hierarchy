-By time
    HDD/Flash > DRAM > L2 Cache/SRAM > L1 Cache/SRAM > CPU/Registers

-As you get faster you have less space. More expensive per byte.

-DRAM: built from capacitor. Charged = 1, otherwise = 0.
    volatile
    needs to be refreshed periodically
    reads are destructive

-SRAM cell is built from 6 transistors. faster but larger than DRAM.
    non-volatile-keeps its value
    does not need to be refreshed.
    reads are not destructive.

-Arranging cells in 2-d structure.

-Example:
    Assume a byte addressable memory that contains 512 bytes
    Need 9 bits to adress one of the 512 bytes.
    Bytes are arranged into an array of 64x8 bytes to keep an aspect ration of one.
    A 9 bit address into a row address (6 bits) and a byte address(3 bits).

-To get data you open a row and then select the byte you need.

-Use banks of data so you need to specify band row and collumn.

-A DIMM consists of 1-4 ranks mounted on a single printed circuit board.

-A Rank consists of multiple parallel chips contributing to the same transaction for example each of of 8 chips can provide a byte for a total of 64 data bits on the channel.

-A bemory chip is organized internally as a number of banks (1-8)

-Multiple banks can execute different commands at the same time.
