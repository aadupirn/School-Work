Homework 6.

1. Mobile 0: 16 * 6.3 = 100.8 mW
   Mobile 2: 4 * 6.3 = 25.2 mW
   Mobile 1: 9 * 6.3 = 21.7 mW

2.
15.8 mW 1, 39.8 mW 2, 100mW 3
Mobile 3 would be at level 0, mobile 2 would be at level 2, and mobile 0 would be at level 4.

If they all transmitted at the same level some codes would send the wrong bits because 1's would be transmitted as zero's because of their low power.

3.
Use Ratio of power transmitted to power received to solve for the radius for each mobile in relation to the original 10m.

5. a) 1/3
   b) 2
   d) 111 110 010 001
   e) 1 away from 000
      2 away from 111
      1 away from 110
      2 away from 001

      It could be 100 or 010

   g) error at time 4, 5, 7
