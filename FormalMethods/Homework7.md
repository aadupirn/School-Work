#### Problem 1

a. {\<s\> | s is a string and |s| is less than 128}

b. {\<A\> | A is a DFA and D accepts at least one string}

c. {\<A\> | A is a DFA and D accepts the empty string}

d. {\<B\> | B is an NFA and the language of N is not empty}

e. {\<C\> | C is a regular expression and C does not generate a specific string }

f. {\<D\> | D is a Turing machine and D loops indefinitely}

g. {\<D\> | D is a Turing machine and T moves the tape head in the left direction}

h. {\<D, E\> | D and E are two Turing machines and D and E recognize the same language.}

i. {\<D, E\> | D and E are two Turing machines and D and E always halt and always leave the same output on the tape for any given input string}

#### Problem 2

a. Completed already on assignment sheet.

b. Create a DFA where when it gets any input it goes to a dead state. This DFA is a decider for the language from 1(c).

c. Do the same as in part b but start with an NFA that does the same and then convert to DFA. It will look the same. 

d. Construct a turing machine based off of machine P in theorem 4.4. If P accepts then reject and otherwise accept.
 
e. ?
