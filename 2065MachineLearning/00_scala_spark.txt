Scala

Scalable language
In Java virtual machine
capable of using external Java libraries.

val a = 1 + 2 + 3

val l = List(1, 2, 3)

l.map(x => x*2)

val m = Map(l-> 2, 2->4)

val m = Map(1->2, 2->4)

m.keys

m.values

can't reassign values to variables (var) you can reassign to val.

Scala data types

	Numbers, Strings "...", Tuples val t = (1, "banana", 2.05), Lists, Maps

you can take tuple values by doing t._1 t._2 t._3

Expressions

	if(condition) expression else expression

for (a<-l) {println(a)}

while has no breaks or continue statements.

val hasUpperCase = name.exists(_.isUpperCase)



Apache Spark

collection of objects spread across cluster
highly fault tolerant (read only data)
iterative algorithms
all data needs to be converted to RDD

write code in terms of transformations and actions

Transformations: Map, filter, union, etc.
Action: Reduce, collect, etc

localhost:4040 for ui when running tasks

textFile.flatMap(line => line.split(" "))

flatMap returns sequence of objects not a single object.

.map(word => (word, 1))

reduceByKey(_ + _)

Don't collect by accident!!

1AON.pdb

start spark with Scala shell:
	1. navigate to spark installation folder.
	2. run ./bin/spark-shell --master local[2] (2 is number of cores)
