-What makes a hardware description language different than a programming language.

-Shifter in this project is being designed using a flow chart.
    Has sequential behavior to it. Before you get to each point you need to know what happened first.
    Could use a huge truth table though.

-VHDL Process Example

    ARCHITECTURE REG4 OF REG4a IS
    BEGIN
        CLKD : process(D, CLK, EN, RST)
        begin
            if(RST = '1') then
                Q <= "0000";
            elseif(CLK'event AND CLK = '0') then
                if(EN = '1') then
                    Q <= D;
                end if;
            end if;
        end process CLKD;
    END REG4;

    SignalName'event is a VHDL keyword that tells you if any signal with this happens assert this.
    line 15 is saying if CLK changes and its 0 then do things, Looking for Falling Edge!!!
    Above is a falling edge trigger 4 big register.

-You have to account for sign shift operator. If you shift right you can't just shift in 0's you have to shift in the sign bit.
