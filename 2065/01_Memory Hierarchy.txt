-Big Data:
    Volume
    Velocity (generation)
    Variety (# of sources)
    Veracity (quality)

-Scalability - how system performance increases as more resources are added

-L1 Cache 1-2ns
-L2 Cache 3-5ns
-L3 Cache 12-20ns
-DRAM 60-200ns
-Memory througput (sequential): 25-50 GB/s

-Spatial Locality
    Referencing items that are stored nearby in memory
        memory caches load an entire cache line (typically 64 bytes) - accessing arr[i] will likely pull arr[i+1] into the cache
        file caches load an entire page (typically 4096 bytes) and often prefetch additional pages

-Temporal Locality
    Referencing the same item over and over again
        stays in cache, only the first reference is an expensive cache miss to memory/disk (unless there is spatial locality as well)

-thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by an operating system scheduler.

-process is an instance of a computer program.

-Synchronization only ensures correctness

-Queue
    Provides one-way communication between many threads/processes (producer-consumer)

-Pipe/Socket
    Provides two-way communication between two threads/processes
    These are examples of communication with message passing
